## Making the RF20 Table

We first look at a subset of the RF20 table which includes the wavelength and reflective_radiation columns. We skip the first row, because it contains information not relevant for the data anaylsis. 

```{r}


df_95 <- read.csv("Ref_Factor_95.csv")


```

## GGPLOT 

```{r}

library(ggplot2)


wavelength <- df_95[1] 
reflective_radiation <- df_95[3]

ggplot(df_95,
      aes(x = wavelength , y = reflective_radiation)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, alpha = 0.25, size = 0.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25, size = 0.5) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.25, size = 0.5)


```
