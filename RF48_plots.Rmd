## want scatterplot with column 1, wavelength, as the x-axis, and column 3, Rad. (Ref.) as the y-axis

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

df_48 = read.csv("Ref_Factor_48.csv", skip = 1)
#skipping the Column.1, Column.2, etc line b/c it's dumb

ggplot(df_48, 
       aes(x = df_48[1], y = df_48[3])) +
  geom_point()


```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
